Thank you for downloading Create on a Potato PC server!

1. To install forge, read "How To Install Servers" by  Kreezxil at: 
https://kreezcraft.com/info__trashed/servers/how-to-install-servers/

2. The link to the correct Forge and Java downloads are found in the file: CURRENT_INSTALLER.txt

3. To start the server:
 - Linux or Mac, open a command prompt and navigate to this folder and execute the file run.sh
 - Windows you can double click the "run.bat" and your server will power up

4. You will then need to open the EULA and change from eula=false to eula=true

5. You will need to start the server again if it did not automatically start
